The 'hsswoa_voss_single_seq' file contains the code for the prediction of coding regions of the benchmark gene sequence F56F11.4 using the HSSWOA algorithm. The 'single_sequence_cds_detection_using_ssa_+_woa' file contains the same code but employing various types of numerical encoding techniques and objective functions. Users must use only one numerical encoding technique and one objective function to test the algorithm. Finally, the 'exon_detection_short_sequence_using_ssa_+_woa' file contains the code to classify CDS regions of any de novo genes. The code for the computation of  various evaluation parameters is also appended in each file.
