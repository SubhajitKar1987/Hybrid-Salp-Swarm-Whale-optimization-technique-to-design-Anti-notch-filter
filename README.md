The 'hsswoa_voss_single_seq' file contains the code for the prediction of coding regions of the benchmark gene sequence F56F11.4 using the HSSWOA algorithm. The second file contains the same code but employing various types of numerical encoding techniques. Users must use only one of them. Finally, the third file contains the code to classify CDS regions of any de novo genes. The code for the computation of  various evaluation parameters is also appended in each file.
